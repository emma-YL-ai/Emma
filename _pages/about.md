## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Hong Kong, passionately pursuing research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and fundamental model-based agents. Under the guidance of Prof. Tao Yu, I am a member of the XLANG Lab and HKU NLP Lab. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, where I specialized in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) under the mentorship of Prof. Chun Yu and Prof. Yuanchun Shi.

## Research Interests

My long-term research goal is to develop autonomous GUI agents capable of:

-   Understanding open-ended natural language and multi-modal instructions.
    
-   Observing and interacting with diverse GUI environments (e.g., OS, mobile) with grounded knowledge.
    
-   Generating executable steps, such as atomic actions, system shortcuts, or code, to complete tasks iteratively.  
    The ultimate aim is to create fundamental large agent models that integrate seamlessly into daily life, akin to ChatGPT, moving beyond prompt-based wrappers of existing LLMs. My research spans data collection, model training/fine-tuning, and evaluation, presenting both challenges and exciting opportunities.  
    Additionally, I am interested in:
    
-   Exploring the application of data science in education.
    
-   Technology-enhanced learning.
    
-   Interdisciplinary applications of data science in digital humanities.
