## About Me

I am a graduated student at the University of Hong Kong, passionately pursuing research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and fundamental model-based agents. I hold a Bachelor's degree in e-Business Management and Information Systems from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I specialized in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) under the mentorship of Dr. Chiu, Dickson K. W. 

## Research Interests

My long-term research goal is to develop autonomous GUI agents capable of:

-   Understanding open-ended natural language and multi-modal instructions.
    
-   Observing and interacting with diverse GUI environments (e.g., OS, mobile) with grounded knowledge.
    
-   Generating executable steps, such as atomic actions, system shortcuts, or code, to complete tasks iteratively.  
    The ultimate aim is to create fundamental large agent models that integrate seamlessly into daily life, akin to ChatGPT, moving beyond prompt-based wrappers of existing LLMs. My research spans data collection, model training/fine-tuning, and evaluation, presenting both challenges and exciting opportunities.  
    Additionally, I am interested in:
    
-   Exploring the application of data science in education.
    
-   Technology-enhanced learning.
    
-   Interdisciplinary applications of data science in digital humanities.
